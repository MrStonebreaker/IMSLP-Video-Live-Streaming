# IMSLP-Video-Live-Streaming
Live video streaming extension for the largest online sheet music community [IMSLP.org](https://www.imslp.org)

IMSLP.org is the largest online sheet music community containing sheet music for most classical music pieces.
This project enabled musicians to provide livestreams of their interpretations of IMSLP music pieces via Youtube Live.

#### Embedded Youtube players

The web-application allowed users to create livestreams via Youtube which were directly referenced on the corresponding IMSLP page 
containing additional information about the played piece e.g. sheet music, composer, date of composition etc.
To do so, a new tab was added that contained all referenced (live) Youtube videos that could be watched and compared while following 
the sheet music displayed on the same IMSLP page.

#### Go live via Youtube and link performance with IMSLP.org

The web-application provided a separated web-page to create livestreams.
